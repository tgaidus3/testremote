# Process Assessment Document - Team X
## Premise
You are a member of an independent quality organization charged with assessing the effectiveness of a software development team. The team has just completed the development of a Java project using a specified Software Process. Prepare a document containing the information described below.

Assume you have access to the following items:
* The team's deliverable documents and source code
* The team's defect log
* The team's time record

# Document Format
## 1 Team members

## 2 Process used

## 3 Activity assessment: for each activity the team used, provide:
* Activity name
* Quality of the deliverable: (0-100, with rationale for score)

## 4 Productivity assessment
* Total time spent
* Total lines of code in delivered product
* Total lines of user documentation
* Productivity score: (0-100, with rationale for score)

## 5 Quality assessment
* Total number of test cases
* Total number of defects found during testing
* Total number of defects fixed
* Quality score: (0-100, with rationale for score)

## 6 Recommendations:
prioritized bullet list of recommendations on how to improve the team's software development process.
## 7 Summary:
One-paragraph summary of the assessment.

## Caveat
You are assessing your own team, so you have a conflict of interest: the more problems you detect with your team's process, the worse your team looks. That is why I have structured this exercise as if you were an independent team from a separate organization. It is your job to be objective. The TA and I will also be evaluating the development team's process. The closer your evaluation score is to ours, the better you will do on this exercise. So be critical but fair.
